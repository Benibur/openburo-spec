## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Reference-implementation framing — clarity beats completeness; every feature must be essential to the broker pattern or illustrate a protocol decision
- Five-dependency stdlib-first stack — coder/websocket, go.yaml.in/yaml/v3, golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt, rs/cors, testify/require
- Four-package layout with unidirectional dependency graph — registry never imports wshub; httpapi is the sole wiring point
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 are parallel-safe (disjoint dependency graphs)

### Critical Research Flags (must land in first commit of their phase)

- **Phase 2:** Symmetric 3×3 wildcard MIME matching with exhaustive test (PITFALLS #2); atomic persistence + in-memory rollback (PITFALLS #5)
- **Phase 3:** `conn.CloseRead(ctx)` + `defer removeSubscriber` (PITFALLS #3); non-blocking drop-slow-consumer fan-out (PITFALLS #4)
- **Phase 4:** Timing-safe Basic Auth (PITFALLS #8); OriginPatterns from shared config, no InsecureSkipVerify (PITFALLS #7); mutation-then-broadcast in handler layer (PITFALLS #1)
- **Phase 5:** Two-phase graceful shutdown (PITFALLS #6)
